 These files contain a C++ framework for an asynchronous streaming server. It took from the gRPC example code and extended it in a way that hopefully will prove useful and extensible. 
  The client is not asynchronous. The client simply makes a single request to the server and the server streams output (which is all odd numbers from 1999 to 1). You can run multiple clients simultaneously and no client should ever starve (ie the server should serve all clients uniformly; to do this I used a trick I learned from reading https://www.gresearch.co.uk/article/lessons-learnt-from-writing-asynchronous-streaming-grpc-services-in-c/). There is only one gRPC server running only one service on port 9314, but the code provides an extensible way to add more services on that port and more servers on other ports without modifying much code.
